Name:       TextEditor (I know, Uninventive) (TEIKU for short ;)
Purpose:    Basic text editor.

Just a little program I'm writing to get more practice with GUI's
and text rendering. Hoping to - in the end - at least get it up
to the level of notepad, as simple a goal as that may sound.

I'm going to try and design my own file selector for
saving/opening, because I hate the Win32 API.
